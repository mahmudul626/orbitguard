### Project Summary

**OrbitGuard** is a web-based SaaS (Software as a Service) platform designed to be an essential tool for satellite operators and launch providers navigating the complexities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Using real-time TLE and SATCAT data from CelesTrak, OrbitGuard not only tracks active satellites but also predicts potential future collisions and helps identify the safest orbital paths for new deployments. Our prototype demonstrates a viable, sustainable, and profitable business model poised to thrive in the new era of LEO commercialization while addressing its most significant challenges.

### The Problem: A Crowded LEO

Low Earth Orbit is rapidly transforming into a commercial hub, with thousands of new satellites being launched. This explosive growth has led to unprecedented orbital congestion and a dramatic increase in the risk posed by space debris. A single collision could destroy multi-million dollar assets, trigger a catastrophic chain reaction of debris (the Kessler Syndrome), and render entire orbits unusable for generations. For satellite operators, mitigating this risk and protecting their assets is a paramount and costly challenge.

### Our Solution: OrbitGuard

OrbitGuard offers a proactive solution to this problem. It moves beyond simple tracking to provide data-driven intelligence that empowers decision-making.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Comprehensive Database & Risk Analysis:** Users can access and filter the entire active satellite database and perform instant risk assessments for any target altitude.
2.  **Advanced Collision Prediction (Pro Feature):** Our advanced algorithms forecast potential conjunction events between objects, giving operators the crucial lead time needed to perform avoidance maneuvers.
3.  **Safe Path Planner (Pro Feature):** Before launching a new satellite, this tool analyzes orbital density around a target altitude to identify the safest, least congested orbital "lanes," promoting long-term sustainability.

### Live Prototype

The code submitted in this project is a functional prototype of the OrbitGuard platform. It runs on a multi-threaded C backend for high performance and serves a modern web interface for an intuitive user experience.

- **Live Demo Link:** `http://localhost:8080/login.html` (after running the server)
- **Test Credentials:**
  - **Email:** test@orbitguard.com
  - **Password:** 1234

### How It Works

-   **Backend:** A custom, multi-threaded server written in C for maximum performance and low-latency data processing. It automatically downloads and processes the latest TLE (Two-Line Element) and SATCAT data from CelesTrak at startup.
-   **Frontend:** A clean and interactive user interface built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
-   **Data Source:** All orbital data is sourced from the highly reliable and globally recognized [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/).

### Business Plan

The OrbitGuard business model is designed to capitalize on the commercial opportunities of LEO while directly addressing its operational, regulatory, and environmental complexities.

#### Value Proposition

-   **Asset Protection:** Safeguarding multi-million dollar satellite assets from catastrophic collisions with other satellites and debris.
-   **Cost Savings:** Reducing insurance premiums and extending satellite operational lifespan by proactively mitigating risks.
-   **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlining mission planning and launch processes by identifying safe orbits and reducing conjunction analysis workload.
-   **Promoting Sustainability:** Contributing to a responsible space economy by helping maintain a clean and safe LEO ecosystem for all.

#### Target Market

1.  **Primary Customers:** Commercial satellite fleet operators (e.g., SpaceX Starlink, OneWeb, Planet Labs).
2.  **Secondary Customers:**
    -   Launch Service Providers (e.g., Rocket Lab, Arianespace).
    -   Space Insurance Companies.
    -   Government Space Agencies (e.g., NASA, ESA, ISRO).
    -   Research and Academic Institutions.

#### Revenue Model

We will employ a **Freemium SaaS** model to build a large user base while generating revenue from professional clients who require advanced capabilities.

1.  **OrbitGuard Free:**
    -   **Features:** Basic satellite tracking, filtering, and limited risk analysis.
    -   **Audience:** Students, researchers, and hobbyists.
2.  **OrbitGuard Pro (Subscription-based):**
    -   **Price:** `$20/user/month` (with discounts for annual billing).
    -   **Features:** All Free features, plus **Advanced Collision Prediction**, **Safe Path Planner**, and data export capabilities.
3.  **OrbitGuard Enterprise / API Access:**
    -   **Price:** Custom pricing.
    -   **Features:** Dedicated API access for large fleets, insurance data modeling, custom integrations, and priority support.

#### Operational Strategy

-   **Technology:** A cloud-native infrastructure (AWS/Google Cloud) will ensure global scalability, high availability, and resilience.
-   **Data:** The data acquisition and processing pipeline will be fully automated for continuous, near real-time updates.
-   **Team:** A lean, agile team comprising orbital mechanics experts, backend/frontend engineers, and business development staff.

#### Cost Structure

-   **Initial Costs:** Further development to transition the prototype into a production-ready product.
-   **Ongoing Costs:** Cloud hosting fees, data source subscriptions (if required), team salaries, and marketing expenses.

#### Addressing Key LEO Challenges

-   **Space Debris & Sustainability:** OrbitGuard's core purpose is to make LEO sustainable. The Safe Path Planner discourages placing satellites in already crowded orbits. The Collision Prediction tool is a direct debris-mitigation strategy, preventing the creation of new debris fields.
-   **Regulatory Environment:** Our platform provides operators with the tools necessary to comply with international guidelines and national regulations, such as the FCC's 5-year de-orbit rule, by enabling better long-term mission planning.
-   **Scalability:** The cloud-based architecture and SaaS model are inherently scalable. The high-performance C backend can handle massive datasets, and the API model allows for limitless integration possibilities.

### Installation & Setup

1.  Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`libcurl`, `pthreads`).
2.  Open a terminal and compile the `server.c` and `cJSON.c` files:
    ```bash
    gcc -o space_debris_server server.c cJSON.c -lcurl -lm -lpthread
    ```
3.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    ./space_debris_server
    ```
4.  Open the `login.html` file in your web browser.

### Future Roadmap

-   **AI-Powered Maneuver Suggestions:** Evolving from prediction to prescription by suggesting the most optimal (fuel-efficient) avoidance maneuvers.
-   **Insurance & Finance Integration:** Providing an API for insurance underwriters to model risk and for operators to quantify the financial benefits of proactive mitigation.
-   **De-orbit Planning Module:** A tool to help plan the end-of-life phase of a satellite, ensuring it can be de-orbited safely and in compliance with regulations.
